# matlab_storm: To Do List #
This is a place for archiving tasks to be completed to bring the core code up to a version suitable for distribution. It also includes a "wish" list of functionality that currently does not exist, but might be nice if it did. 

## To Do List ##
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Wish List ##
1. All paths are self referential.  So the user need only specify the location of \matlab-storm\.
a. The goal here is to lower the number dependencies and also the number of paths that must be hardcoded.  
2. Utilize loadlibrary for interfacing with various dlls
3. Develop work around for current GPU code for rendering
a. Write c-code to render quickly (Jeff)
4. Extend molecule list format
5. Create matlab wrapper for daostorm
6. Convert all globals in GUIs to be cell arrays indexed by the ID# of the GUI
