# matlab_storm: To Do List #
This is a place for archiving tasks to be completed to bring the core code up to a version suitable for distribution. It also includes a "wish" list of functionality that currently does not exist, but might be nice if it did. 

## To Do List ##
1. ...

## Wish List ##
1. Include all necessary dlls for InsightM, DAOSTORM, and L1-Homotopy in a library file. Then the startup.m file will automatically know where to find these functions. Moreover, because the needed dlls can be included in the same lib folder, it will not be necessary to have the user set a variety of paths.  Setting basePath to the installation path for matlab-storm will be sufficient.
