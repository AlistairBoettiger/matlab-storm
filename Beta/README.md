# Beta Folder #
Code in this folder is functional but may be in development.  The code may contain obvious bugs that are being worked out.
Code does not need to meet the standards set out in the Functions folder (see Functions readme).  For example, specific properties are hard coded, the code is computer or setup specific, or the code is simply not as general as it should be.
None the less it should functional code that does work on at least one computer.  Most code should be functions with help files to explain the input and outputs.   
Please do not load non-functional code here.  

All code should be loaded in a folder with a README.md text file that explains the basic function of the code and provides some instructions on how to use it.
