# Beta Folder #
Code in this folder is functional but not in a 'clean' form. In other words, specific properties are hard coded, the code is computer or setup specific, or the code is simply not as general as it should be.  None the less it is functional code that does work on at least one computer.  Please do not load non-functional code here.  

All code should be loaded in a folder with a README.md text file that explains the basic function of the code and provides some instructions on how to use it.
