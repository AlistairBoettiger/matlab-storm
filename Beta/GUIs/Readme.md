# Beta GUIs 

Welcome to Beta GUIs.  This folder will generally house some of the latest tools for processing STORM data with Matlab.
This code may still have bugs and some functions may not yet be fully implimented.  


# Current Projects

## STORMfinderBeta
This GUI is the development version of the STORMfinder GUI available in the main GUI programs.

### New Features
* automated, iterative computation of z-calibration curves from bead data.

### In Development
* automated computation of 2D and 3D chromatic field correction.  
*  Currently chromatic field correction expects 4 two sets of bead images -- IR images which contain images of beads in the 750 channel and 647 channel, and Vis beads which contain images in the 647, 561 and 488 channel.  See help files for additional information.
